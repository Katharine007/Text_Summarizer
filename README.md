# 📝 Text Summarizer

This project implements both **Extractive** and **Abstractive Text Summarization** techniques using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The extractive method selects the most important sentences from the text, while the abstractive method uses a pre-trained transformer model to generate a human-like summary.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Preprocessing with tokenization and stopword removal
- 📊 Compression of long texts into concise summaries
- 👩‍💻 Easy-to-understand implementation in a Jupyter Notebook with a GUI implementation as well
- 
- ✅ **Extractive Summarization**
  - Frequency-based sentence scoring
  - Uses NLTK and spaCy for preprocessing
- ✅ **Abstractive Summarization**
  - Based on a fine-tuned transformer model 
  - Uses Hugging Face Transformers
